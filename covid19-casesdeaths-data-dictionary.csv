Notes: ,,
1) The denominator for rate calculations uses Statistics Canada 2021 Q3 population estimates unless otherwise specified. Refer to the current quarterly population estimates.,,
2) Canada metrics  for the last 7 and last 14 days include only jurisdictions that have complete data within the latest reporting weeks.,,
"3) This information is based on data published by our provincial and territorial partners on cases, deaths, and testing. For the most up to date data for any province, territory or city, please visit their website. The number of cases or deaths reported in previous weeks may differ slightly from those on the provincial and territorial websites. This is because they may go back and update their case and death counts as new information becomes available.",,
4) Metrics should be interpreted with caution as they are subject to data corrections or backfill (sometimes described as ?bulk? reporting) from jurisdictions.,,
"5) When a jurisdiction reports one number of new cases or deaths over a number of days, the cases or deaths are distributed evenly over the time period for which the P/T report reflects (e.g. if 30 new cases are reported on a Monday, compared to the previous Friday, 10 ""reported cases"" will be attributed to each of Saturday, Sunday and Monday). This dataset uses current P/T reporting practices to calculate all historic and current case and death counts.",,
"6) These data are updated every Friday, at 9:00 am EST. ",,
